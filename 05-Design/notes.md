-WEB DESIGN VS. DEVELOPMENT-
a) Web 'designers' create the overall look and feel of a website
b) web 'developers' implement the design using 'HTML, CSS and JavaScript code'

-GOOD DESIGN-
a) Creates an immediate and lasting 'good impression' of the brand or product
b) Makes the user 'trust' the brand right away
c) Increases the user's 'perceived value' of the brand or product
d) Gives users exactly 'what they were looking for' when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information

-BAD DESIGN-
a) Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service
b) Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand
c) Makes the brand or product seem 'cheap'
d) Leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to reach their goal

1. TYPOGRAPHY

- Typography is the art and technique of arrranging type to make written language 'legible, 'readable' and 'appealing' when displayed

a) Use Good Typefaces

- Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
- It's okay to use one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
- Choose the 'right typeface' according to your website personality

b) Sizes and Weights

- When choosing font-sizes, 'limit choices!' Use a 'type scale' tool or other 'pre-defined range'
- Use a font size between 16px and 32px for 'normal' text -->
- For 'long text' (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
- For 'headlines', you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), 'depending on personality'
- For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

c) Reading Experience

- Use less than 75 characters per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 (The 'smaller' or 'longer' the text, the 'larger' the line height needs to be!)
- Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
- Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and decrease letter-spacing
- Usually, don't justify text
- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

2. COLORS

a) Choose the Right Color

- Make the main color 'match your website's personality: colors convety meaning!
- Use a 'good color tone!' Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors

b) Establish a Color System

- You need at least two types of colors in your 'color palette': a 'main color' and a 'grey color'
- With more experience, you can add more color: 'accent (secondary) colors' (use a tool)
- For diversity, create lighter and darket 'versions (tints and shades)

c) When and how to use Colors

- Use your main color to 'draw attention' to the most important elements on the page
- Use colors to add 'interesting accents' or make 'entire components or sections' stand out
- You can try to use your color strategically in 'images and illustrattions'

d) Colors and Typography

- On dark colored backgrounds, try to 'use a tint of the background' ('lighter version') for text
- Text should usually not be completely black. 'Lighten it up' it looks heavy and uninviting
- 'Don't make text too light!' Use a tool to check contrast between text and blackground colors

3. IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

a) Using Good Images

- Diffrent types of images: 'product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns'
- Use images to support your website's 'message and story'. So only use 'relevant images!'
- Prefer 'original images'. If not possible, use 'original-looking' stock images (not generic ones!)

b) Use Images well

- Try to show 'real people' to trigger user's emotions
- If necessary, 'crop images' to fit your message.
- Experiment 'combining' photos, illustrations and patterns

c) Handling Text on Images

- Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
- Method #2: Position text into neutral image area
- Method #3: Put text in a box

d) Some Technical Details

- To account for 'high-res screens', make image dimensions '2x as big' as their desplayed size
- 'Compress images' for a lower file size and better performance
- When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the 'exact same dimensions'
