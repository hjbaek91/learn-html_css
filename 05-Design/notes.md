-WEB DESIGN VS. DEVELOPMENT-
a) Web 'designers' create the overall look and feel of a website
b) web 'developers' implement the design using 'HTML, CSS and JavaScript code'

-GOOD DESIGN-
a) Creates an immediate and lasting 'good impression' of the brand or product
b) Makes the user 'trust' the brand right away
c) Increases the user's 'perceived value' of the brand or product
d) Gives users exactly 'what they were looking for' when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information

-BAD DESIGN-
a) Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service
b) Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand
c) Makes the brand or product seem 'cheap'
d) Leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to reach their goal

1. TYPOGRAPHY

- Typography is the art and technique of arrranging type to make written language 'legible, 'readable' and 'appealing' when displayed

a) Use Good Typefaces

- Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
- It's okay to use one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
- Choose the 'right typeface' according to your website personality

b) Sizes and Weights

- When choosing font-sizes, 'limit choices!' Use a 'type scale' tool or other 'pre-defined range'
- Use a font size between 16px and 32px for 'normal' text -->
- For 'long text' (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
- For 'headlines', you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), 'depending on personality'
- For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

c) Reading Experience

- Use less than 75 characters per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 (The 'smaller' or 'longer' the text, the 'larger' the line height needs to be!)
- Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
- Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and decrease letter-spacing
- Usually, don't justify text
- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

<!--  -->

2. COLORS

a) Choose the Right Color

- Make the main color 'match your website's personality: colors convety meaning!
- Use a 'good color tone!' Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors

b) Establish a Color System

- You need at least two types of colors in your 'color palette': a 'main color' and a 'grey color'
- With more experience, you can add more color: 'accent (secondary) colors' (use a tool)
- For diversity, create lighter and darket 'versions (tints and shades)

c) When and how to use Colors

- Use your main color to 'draw attention' to the most important elements on the page
- Use colors to add 'interesting accents' or make 'entire components or sections' stand out
- You can try to use your color strategically in 'images and illustrattions'

d) Colors and Typography

- On dark colored backgrounds, try to 'use a tint of the background' ('lighter version') for text
- Text should usually not be completely black. 'Lighten it up' it looks heavy and uninviting
- 'Don't make text too light!' Use a tool to check contrast between text and blackground colors

<!--  -->

3. IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

a) Using Good Images

- Diffrent types of images: 'product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns'
- Use images to support your website's 'message and story'. So only use 'relevant images!'
- Prefer 'original images'. If not possible, use 'original-looking' stock images (not generic ones!)

b) Use Images well

- Try to show 'real people' to trigger user's emotions
- If necessary, 'crop images' to fit your message.
- Experiment 'combining' photos, illustrations and patterns

c) Handling Text on Images

- Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
- Method #2: Position text into neutral image area
- Method #3: Put text in a box

d) Some Technical Details

- To account for 'high-res screens', make image dimensions '2x as big' as their desplayed size
- 'Compress images' for a lower file size and better performance
- When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the 'exact same dimensions'

<!--  -->

4. ICONS

a) Use Good Icons

- Use a 'good icon pack', there are tons of 'free' and paid icons packs.
- Use only one icon pack. 'Don't mix' icons from different icon packs.
- Use 'SVG icons' or 'icon fonts' for good image scaling. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
- Adjust to website personality! 'Roundness, weight and filled/outlined' depend on typography.

b) When to use Icons

- Use icons to 'provide visual assistance' to text.
- Use icons for 'product feature blocks'.
- Use icons 'associated with actions', and 'label them' (unless no space or icon is 100% clear).
- Use icons 'as bullet points'.

c) Use Icons Well

- To keep icons neutral, 'use same color as text'. To draw more attention, 'use different color'.
- Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and 'fit the text or action!'
- Don't make icons larger than what they 'were designed for'. If needed, 'enclose them in a shape'.

<!--  -->

5. SHADOWS

a) Use Shadows Well

- You 'don't have to use' shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the 'website personality'.
- Use shadows 'in small doses': don't add shadows to every element!
- Go light on shadows, don't make them 'too dark'!

b) Use Shadows in the Right Situation

- Use 'small shadows' for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention).
- Use 'medium-sized shadows' for larger areas that should stand out a bit more.
- Use 'large shadows' for elements that should really 'float above' the interface.
- Experiment with 'changing shadows' on mouse interaction (click and hover).
- Bonus: Experiment with 'glows' (colored shadows).

<!--  -->

6. BORDER-RADIUS

a) Use Border-Radius Well

- Use border-radius to 'increase the playfulness' and fun of the design, to make it 'less serious'.
- Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius 'matches the roundness!'
- Use border-radius on 'buttons, images, around icons, standout sections and other elements'.

<!--  -->

7. WHITESPACE

a) Why Whitespace?

- The right amount of whitespace makes designs look 'clean, modern and polished'.
- Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are 'related to one another'.
- Whitespace implies 'invisible relationships between the elements' of a layout.

b) Where to Use Whitespace

- Use tons of whitespace 'between sections'.
- Use a lot of whitespace 'between groups of elements'.
- Use whitespace 'between elements'.
- Inside 'group of elements', try to use whitespace 'instead of lines'.

c) How Much Whitespace

- 'The more some elements' (or groups of elements) 'belong together, the closer they should be!'
- Start with 'a lot of whitespace', maybe even too much! Then 'remove whitespace' from there.
- Match 'other design choices'. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace.
- Try a hard rule, such as using 'multiples of 16px' for all spacing.

<!--  -->

8. VISUAL HIERARCHY

a) What is Visual Hierarchy?

- Visual hierarchy is about 'establishing which elements' of a design 'are the most important ones'.
- Visual hierarchy is about 'drawing attention' to these most important elements.
- Visual hierarchy is about 'defining a path for users', to 'guide' them through the page.
- We use a combination of 'position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows' to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components.

b) Visual Hierarchy Fundamentals

- Position important elements 'closer to the top of the page', where they get more attention (attention flows down the page).
- Use images mindfully, as they draw 'a lot of attention' (larger images get more attention).
- Whitespace creates separation, so 'use whitespace strategically' to emphasize elements.

c) Visual Hierarchy for Text Elements

- For text elements, use 'font size, font weight, color, and whitespace' to convey importance.
- What text elements to emphasize? 'Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons' (At the same time, we can 'de-emphasize' less important texts).

d) Visual Hierarchy between Components

- Emphasize an importnat component using 'background color, shadow, or border' (or multiple).
- Try emphasizing some component A over component B by 'de-emphasizing component B'.
- What components to emphasize? 'Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.'

9. User Experience (UX)

- 'User Interface (UI)' : the visual presentation of a product. It's how the graphical interface looks and feels like.
- 'User Experience (UX)' : the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product.

a) UI and UX Design

- Both need to be intertwined well in order to create a good webpage.

b) Goals

- A website or application 'exists for a reason': a 'user' has a goal for 'visiting' it, and a 'business' has a goal for 'creating' it.

c) Usability

- Don't design complicated layouts. don't reinvent the wheel. 'Use patterns that users know'.
- Make your call-to-action the 'most prominent element', and make the 'text descriptive'.
- Use 'blue text' and 'underlined text' only for links!
- Animations should have a 'purpose' and be 'fast': between 200 and 500 ms.
- In forms, align labels and fields in a 'single vertical line', to make the form 'easier to scan'.
- Offer users 'good feeback' for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. [web apps]
- Place action buttons where they will 'create an effect' (law of locality) [web apps]

d) Website Content

- Use a 'descriptive, keyword-focused headline' on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy!
- Only include 'relevant information', efficiently! 'Cut out fluff' and make the content 100% clear.
- Use 'simple words!' Avoid technical jargon and 'smart-sounding' words.
- Break up long text with 'sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points', etc.
