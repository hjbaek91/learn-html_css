# Process of Building a Website

## DEFINE

- Define 'WHO the website is for'. Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?

- Define 'WHAT the website is for'. In other words, define 'business and user goals' of your website project.

- Define a 'target audience'. Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this can come from your client).

## PLAN

- Plan and gather 'website content': copy (text), images, videos etc.

- Content is usually 'provided by the client', but you also can help them produce and find some content.

- For bigger sites, plan out the 'sitemap': what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy).

- Based on the content, plan what 'sections' each page needs in orer to convey the content's message, and in which order.

- Define the 'website personality'.

## SKETCH

- Think about what 'components' you need, and how you can use them in 'layout patterns'.

- 'Get ideas out of your head': sketch them with 'pen and paper' or with some design software (e.g. Figma).

- This is an 'iterative processs': experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution.

- You don't need to sketch everything, and 'don't make it perfect'. At some point, you're ready to jump into HTML and CSS.

## DESIGN AND BUILD

- Use decisions, content and sketches from Steps1, 2 and 3 to 'design and build the website with HTML and CSS' (“designing in the browser”).

- You already have the 'layout' and 'components' that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual 'visual styles'.

- Create the design based on selected 'website personality'.

- Use the 'client's branding' (it if exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: 'colors, typography, icons', etc.

## TEST AND OPTIMIZE

- Make sure website works well in 'all major browser' (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, maybe even old IE).

- Test the website on 'actual mobile devices', not just in DevTools.

- Optimize all 'images', in terms of dimensions and file size.

- Fix simple 'accessibility' problem (e.g. color contrast issues).

- Run the 'Lighthouse' performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues.

- Think about 'Search Engine Optimization' (SEO).

## LAUNCH

- Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client (or yourself), it's time to 'share your masterpiece with the world!'

- Upload your website files to a 'hosting platform'. There are countless platform such as 'Netlify'.

- Choose and buy a great 'domain name'., one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write.

## MAINTAIN AND UPDATE

- Launching is not the end...

- Keep the website content 'updated over time'.

- Install 'analytics software' (e.g. Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website useres. This may 'inform future changes' in the site structure and content.

- A 'blog' that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users ocming back, and is also good for SEO.
