        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are
        the languages of the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
        language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
        of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

      <!-- <ol> : list with numbers -->
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You can learn more at
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN Web Docs</a
        >
        ><!-- Use target="_blank" to make the link open a new tab -->
      </p>

      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>

      <!-- <ul> : list with no order -->
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>

<!-- Note on Semantic HTML -->
<!-- We use semantic HTML to give 'meaning' to the HTML elements we code. Visually, they do not change anything. However, this helps the browser see the structure of the code that is written. This also helps people who view the browser using screen reader. Most importantly, we give meaning to the structure of the elements through semantic HTML! -->
